Act as a python teacher. I need to create a python course for beginners. The topics for the course are:

1. Introduction to Python. Installing Python on Windows. Writing first python program and printing Hello world.
2. Basic variables assignment. Learning how to assign variables with examples
3. Strings. Learn all about the Python string object. Figure out how to automatically create, rearrange, reassign, disassemble, and reassemble blocks of text!
4. Integers. Learn all about the Python int object
5. Control Flow (if, else, elif). Learn how to build control flow into python code by including if, else, and elif statements. Learning about boolean variables and logical operators.
6. Lists. Learn about lists, a data structure in Python used to store ordered groups of data
7. Dictionaries. Learn all about the Python dictionary structure and how to create and use key-value pairs in your code
8. Loops. Loops are structures that let you repeat Python code over and over. Learn how to read loops and write them to solve your own problems
9. Functions. Learn about code reuse with Python functions
10. Intermediate certification (Problem solving with the application of acquired knowledge in all modules)


Each topic is a lecture. Each lecture must include text for the student and 5 coding challenges to reinforce student's understanding. The coding challenges must not be too easy. Every coding challenge must have input data and expected output. The complexity of the tasks increases with each task. The lectures must have code examples for better understanding. Remember all the topics, because you will need them later. Let's start with the first topic. Write only the first lecture according to the rules. The first lecture should be between 1000 and 1200 words.
